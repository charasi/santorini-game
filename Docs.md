In Isometric Projection (like in your game):
You're manually converting grid coordinates into screen space using isometric math like:

ts
Copy
Edit
const isoX = (col - row) * (tileWidth / 2);
const isoY = (col + row) * (tileHeight / 2);
This simulates an isometric view on top of a standard top-left origin 2D canvas (PixiJS). So:

üìå In Isometric Terms:
(0, 0) is usually the top of your isometric "diamond".

(0, 1) means:

Move one tile down-right in isometric view.

This moves the screen position right and down.

Because in screen space:

ts
Copy
Edit
isoX = (0 - 1) * (tileWidth / 2) = -32
isoY = (0 + 1) * (tileHeight / 2) = 16
So (0, 1) ‚Üí (isoX: -32, isoY: 16)

üîÑ Summary Comparison
Grid Coord	2D Screen (Pixi)	Isometric Conversion	Visual Effect
(0, 0)	Top-left	Center of map	Top of diamond
(0, 1)	1 pixel down	Down-right on grid	‚¨áÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è in isometric
(1, 0)	1 pixel right	Up-right on grid	‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è in isometric
(1, 1)	Diagonal in 2D	Directly right	‚û°Ô∏è in isometric

üß† So to answer directly:
‚ùì"In isometric, does (0, 1) mean 'stay at x and go down 1'?"
No ‚Äî in isometric coordinates, (0, 1) means:

Go diagonally down-right on the screen.

Both x and y change due to the isometric transformation.

Each step in the isometric grid shifts the position both horizontally and vertically in screen space.

üìê Coordinate Conversion Formula
You're already doing this (correctly):

ts
Copy
Edit
const isoX = (col - row) * (tileWidth / 2);   // 32px
const isoY = (col + row) * (tileHeight / 2);  // 16px
So:

Grid Coord (x, y)	Isometric Screen (isoX, isoY)	Explanation
(0, 0)	(0, 0)	Top-center of map
(1, 0)	(32, 16)	Move down-right (‚ÜòÔ∏è)
(0, 1)	(-32, 16)	Move down-left (‚ÜôÔ∏è)
(1, 1)	(0, 32)	Move straight down (‚¨áÔ∏è)
(2, 0)	(64, 32)	Further down-right
(0, 2)	(-64, 32)	Further down-left

üß† Key Insight
In isometric:

(0, 1) does not just move you down.

It moves you down-left (both x and y change).

The isometric view distorts the meaning of axes from Cartesian 2D.

‚úÖ Forward Projection: Map ‚Üí Screen
If your isometric tiles are:

TILE_WIDTH = 128

TILE_HEIGHT = 64

Then: TILE_WIDTH_HALF = 64, TILE_HEIGHT_HALF = 32

To draw a tile from grid position (map.x, map.y):

ts
Copy
Edit
screen.x = (map.x - map.y) * TILE_WIDTH_HALF;
screen.y = (map.x + map.y) * TILE_HEIGHT_HALF;
Result: Moves right/down as map.x increases, and left/down as map.y increases.

üîÑ Reverse Projection: Screen ‚Üí Map
To convert a screen click/pixel (screen.x, screen.y) back into tile coordinates:

ts
Copy
Edit
map.x = (screen.x / TILE_WIDTH_HALF + screen.y / TILE_HEIGHT_HALF) / 2;
map.y = (screen.y / TILE_HEIGHT_HALF - screen.x / TILE_WIDTH_HALF) / 2;
Use case: Detect which tile was clicked, or determine which tile a character is over.

üß† Intuitive Movement Recap
Map Œî	Screen Direction
(+1, 0)	‚û°Ô∏è + ‚¨áÔ∏è (right-down)
(0, +1)	‚¨ÖÔ∏è + ‚¨áÔ∏è (left-down)
(-1, 0)	‚¨ÖÔ∏è + ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (left-up)
(0, -1)	‚û°Ô∏è + ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (right-up)

This helps you reason about direction logic or pathfinding visually.

‚úÖ Practical Tips
Origin tile (0, 0) appears at (0, 0) or an offset like (startX, startY) depending on your design.

Keep your map grid logic separate from rendering logic. Do all gameplay math in map.x/map.y, and only project when drawing or handling input.

Round the result of reverse projection with Math.floor if you want integer tile indices.

Regular (square) grid ‚Äî easy mode
Imagine a regular grid like a chessboard. If you want to draw a tile at position (2, 1), you do:

ini
Copy
Edit
x = 2 * tile width
y = 1 * tile height
Everything is in a straight line. Easy.

‚óá Isometric grid ‚Äî trickier, but cool-looking
Now imagine tilting the grid like diamonds ‚¨® so it looks 3D. This is isometric.

It still uses the same kind of grid in memory (rows and columns), but we draw it differently on screen to get that 3D illusion.

üí° How to draw an isometric tile
Let's say your tile is a diamond:

tileWidth = 128

tileHeight = 64

So half-width = 64, half-height = 32

When you want to draw tile (x, y), use this magic formula:

ini
Copy
Edit
screenX = (x - y) * halfTileWidth
screenY = (x + y) * halfTileHeight
What this means in plain words:

Moving right in your grid (x + 1) moves the tile right and down on screen.

Moving down in your grid (y + 1) moves the tile left and down on screen.

üñ±Ô∏è What if I click the screen and want to know which tile that is?
You flip the formula!

Given screenX and screenY, use this to figure out the tile:

ini
Copy
Edit
x = (screenX / halfTileWidth + screenY / halfTileHeight) / 2
y = (screenY / halfTileHeight - screenX / halfTileWidth) / 2
This tells you: "Hey, based on this pixel, you're clicking tile (x, y)".

Just remember to round it down if you want whole numbers (like tile 2,1 instead of 2.3, 1.7).

‚úÖ TL;DR ‚Äî You only need to memorize:
To draw a tile:
ts
Copy
Edit
screenX = (x - y) * tileWidth / 2
screenY = (x + y) * tileHeight / 2
To get the tile from a screen click:
ts
Copy
Edit
x = (screenX / (tileWidth / 2) + screenY / (tileHeight / 2)) / 2
y = (screenY / (tileHeight / 2) - screenX / (tileWidth / 2)) / 2

**********************************************************************************************************

üéÆ What are we doing?
We want to draw tiles (like flat diamond-shaped floor pieces) in a cool fake 3D way called isometric view.

üß± First: What‚Äôs a tile?
Imagine a tile is shaped like a diamond:

It‚Äôs 128 pixels wide

And 64 pixels tall

So from the middle to the sides is 64
From the middle to the top/bottom is 32

üß† How do we draw the tile at grid spot (x, y)?
Use this simple formula:

ini
Copy
Edit
screenX = (x - y) * 64
screenY = (x + y) * 32
(We use 64 and 32 because they‚Äôre half of 128 and 64)

ü§î What does this do?
Let's say your map looks like this (each tile has an x,y coordinate):

scss
Copy
Edit
(0,0) (1,0) (2,0)
(0,1) (1,1) (2,1)
(0,2) (1,2) (2,2)
When you draw the tiles:

(0,0) is the center starting point

(1,0) ‚Üí moves right and down

(0,1) ‚Üí moves left and down

üß≠ Think of this like:

x + 1 goes ‚ÜòÔ∏è (right + down)

y + 1 goes ‚ÜôÔ∏è (left + down)

That‚Äôs how you get the tilted look.

‚úÖ Example
Let‚Äôs draw tile (1, 0):

ini
Copy
Edit
screenX = (1 - 0) * 64 = 64
screenY = (1 + 0) * 32 = 32
So the tile gets drawn at pixel (64, 32).

Now tile (0, 1):

ini
Copy
Edit
screenX = (0 - 1) * 64 = -64
screenY = (0 + 1) * 32 = 32
It shows up on the left and down.

üó∫ Summary
Use the magic formula.

x - y controls how far left or right.

x + y controls how far down.

That makes your grid look like a tilted diamond map.

**********************************************************************************************************

üß± First: What is a tile?
Imagine a tile in your game is a diamond shape.

Not a square. Not a circle. A tilted diamond like this:

markdown
Copy
Edit
/\
/  \
\  /
\/
Each tile is:

128 pixels wide (from left to right)

64 pixels tall (from top to bottom)

So the middle of the tile is:

64 pixels to the left/right

32 pixels to the top/bottom

üß† How do I put a tile on the screen?
Every tile has a grid position like (x, y) ‚Äî like in a spreadsheet or chessboard.

But since we're drawing these diamonds in a tilted, isometric way, we don‚Äôt just multiply like normal.

We use this magic:

ini
Copy
Edit
screenX = (x - y) * 64
screenY = (x + y) * 32
Why 64 and 32?
Because:

128 (tile width) √∑ 2 = 64

64 (tile height) √∑ 2 = 32

That‚Äôs how far to move in pixels.

ü§î What does the formula do?
It turns your grid position (x, y) into a pixel position (screenX, screenY) on the screen.

That way you know exactly where to draw the diamond.

Let‚Äôs say your map grid is:

scss
Copy
Edit
(0,0) (1,0) (2,0)
(0,1) (1,1) (2,1)
(0,2) (1,2) (2,2)
In a normal square grid, you'd draw them all in a flat square layout.

But isometric drawing means:

(0, 0) is your starting center.

Move x + 1 ‚Üí goes right and down ‚ÜòÔ∏è

Move y + 1 ‚Üí goes left and down ‚ÜôÔ∏è

So each step down stacks diamonds diagonally!

‚úÖ Example 1: Draw tile (1, 0)
Plug into the formula:

ini
Copy
Edit
screenX = (1 - 0) * 64 = 64
screenY = (1 + 0) * 32 = 32
So draw it at screen position: (64, 32)

It moves right and down from the center.

‚úÖ Example 2: Draw tile (0, 1)
ini
Copy
Edit
screenX = (0 - 1) * 64 = -64
screenY = (0 + 1) * 32 = 32
Draw it at screen position: (-64, 32)

It moves left and down from the center.

üó∫ TL;DR
You use (x - y) to figure out how far left/right the tile is.

You use (x + y) to figure out how far down it is.

This makes your grid look like a cool 3D map (even though it's 2D).

*******************************************************************************************************

üéÆ Imagine This Simple Grid (top-down view)
This is what you think you have in your head for a normal grid:

scss
Copy
Edit
(0,0) (1,0) (2,0)
(0,1) (1,1) (2,1)
(0,2) (1,2) (2,2)
In a normal square game, going from (0,0) to (0,1) just means going straight down. Easy.

BUT‚Ä¶ in isometric view, we‚Äôre making it look like the map is rotated toward you in 3D. Like you're looking at it from a corner, like a tilted board game.

üß± The Diamond Tiles
Each tile is a diamond (tilted square), like this:

Copy
Edit
/\
/  \
\  /
\/
And we stack these diamonds diagonally to make the map look 3D.

üß† OK, so what happens when I draw (0, 0)?
Let‚Äôs say you start with tile (0, 0) and draw it in the center of your screen.

Then you want to draw tile (0, 1).

üé® Visually, what does (0, 1) mean?
In grid logic, (0, 1) means:

Same X (stay in the same column)

Y goes +1 (go down a row)

In a normal grid, that‚Äôs just down.

But in isometric, when you move ‚Äúdown a row,‚Äù the diamond shifts:

Left on the screen (because isometric tiles go diagonally)

Down on the screen (because you‚Äôre going deeper into the map)

So the diamond tile appears left and down.

üß† What about (1, 0)?
That‚Äôs:

Right one column

Same row

In isometric view, it goes:

Right and down

So:

(0, 1) ‚Üí ‚ÜôÔ∏è (left + down)

(1, 0) ‚Üí ‚ÜòÔ∏è (right + down)

üó∫ Final Mental Trick: Diagonal Layers
If you draw this, you'll see that each row of tiles in grid space actually becomes a diagonal layer on screen:


(0,0)
/     \
(0,1)   (1,0)
\       /
(1,1)
It‚Äôs not up/down/left/right anymore ‚Äî every move feels diagonal.

So your brain wants up/down/left/right, but isometric tiles cheat the angle to look 3D.
